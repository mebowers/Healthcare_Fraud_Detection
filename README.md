# Healthcare Fraud Detection
This is my final machine learning project for NYC Data Science Academy where I explore the business costs of machine learning algorithms for predicting healthcare provider fraud.

## Data Overview
The data comes from Kaggle's [Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis) Train_ datasets and includes beneficary, provider, inpatient, and outpatient data.

## Project Highlights
I explored the beneficiary and claims datasets using a series of warmup questions provided by NYC Data Science Academy with the ultimate goal of creating provider level data for fraud analysis. 

The warmup question notebooks contain the following work:

- Warmup_Q1: beneficiary and physician EDA
- Warmup_Q2: beneficiary EDA
- Warmup_Q3: time series analysis
- Warmup_Q4: claim-level EDA
- Warmup_Q5: duplicate claims, physician and patient ID reuse, geographic trends

After creating provider level data, I evaluated logistic regression models and ensemble tree models focusing on the expense of false negatives and false positives in order to advise businesses on the cost efficiency of each algorithm.
