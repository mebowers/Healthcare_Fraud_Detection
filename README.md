# Healthcare Fraud Detection
This is my final machine learning project for NYC Data Science Academy where I explore the business costs of machine learning algorithms for predicting healthcare provider fraud.

## Data Overview
The data comes from Kaggle's [Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis) train datasets.

## Project Highlights
I explored the dataset using a series of warmup questions provided by NYC Data Science Academy and then created provider level data for analysis. I evaluated logistic regression models and ensemble tree models. I investigated classification metrics best suited to evaluating model performance focusing on the expense of false negatives and false positives in order to advise businesses on the cost efficiency of each algorithm.
