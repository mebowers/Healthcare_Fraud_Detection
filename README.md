# Healthcare Fraud Detection
This is my final machine learning project for NYC Data Science Academy where I explore the business costs of machine learning algorithms for predicting healthcare provider fraud.

## Data Overview
The data comes from Kaggle's [Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis) Train_ datasets. 

I have included the following files:
- [Provider-level data](provider_level_data.csv), created for modeling 
- [Capstone data dictionary](Capstone_data_dictionary.pdf), created by author

## Project Highlights
I explored the beneficiary and claims datasets using a series of warmup questions provided by NYC Data Science Academy with the ultimate goal of creating provider level data for fraud analysis. 

The warmup question notebooks are based on the HealthCare Fraud Detection Project Proposal questions and contain the following work:

- [Warmup Q1](Warmup_Q1.ipynb): beneficiary and physician EDA
- [Warmup Q2](Warmup_Q2.ipynb): beneficiary EDA
- [Warmup Q3](Warmup_Q3.ipynb): time series analysis
- [Warmup Q4](Warmup_Q4.ipynb): claim-level EDA
- [Warmup Q5](Warmup_Q5.ipynb): duplicate claims, physician and patient ID reuse, geographic trends

After creating provider level data, I evaluated logistic regression models and ensemble tree models focusing on the expense of false negatives and false positives in order to advise businesses on the cost efficiency of each algorithm.
